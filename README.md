🦙 LLaMA 4 from Scratch: Python & Rust

From Zero to LLaMA 4: Crafting a Language Model with Python and Rust

This project offers a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation of the LLaMA 4 architecture using both Python and Rust. It serves as an educational resource for understanding and building large language models (LLMs) from the ground up.

🚀 Features
• Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): Efficient computation through sparse activation.
• Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE): Enhanced positional awareness in transformers.
• RMSNorm: Stabilized training with root mean square layer normalization.
• Character-Level Tokenization: Granular text processing.
• Modular Python Codebase: Clean and organized structure for ease of understanding.
• Rust Integration: Performance-critical components implemented in Rust for speed and efficiency.
• Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive exploration and experimentation.

🧠 Architecture Overview

The LLaMA 4 model integrates several advanced components:
• Transformer Blocks: Utilizing Multi-Head Attention mechanisms.
• Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFN): For complex transformations.
• Causal Masking: Ensuring autoregressive behavior during training.
• Final Output Layer: Producing token probabilities for generation tasks.
